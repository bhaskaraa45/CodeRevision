# CodeRevision

Sometimes, we forget certain approaches or syntax that we have previously used. To address this, I have developed an app that allows you to save your solved/tried CP problems and revise them later.

With this app, you can easily store your solved/tried/wishlist problems and access them whenever you need to refresh your memory.

## Installation

1. Download the APK file from the releases section of this repository. or you can use this link [Download](https://github.com/bhaskaraa45/CodeRevision/raw/main/app/release/app-release.apk)

2. Transfer the APK file to your Android device.

3. On your Android device, go to Settings > Security or Privacy (depending on your device) and enable "Unknown Sources" to allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store.

4. Open the File Manager on your Android device and navigate to the location where you transferred the APK file.

5. Tap on the APK file to start the installation process.

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
